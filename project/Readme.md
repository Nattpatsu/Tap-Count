# Tap Count Project

project inspiration: [samvlu](https://github.com/samvlu)/**[web-04-tap-counter](https://github.com/samvlu/web-04-tap-counter)**

### _issue_

When I workout, I have to keep track of my sets, usually around 5 or 6. Sometimes I lose count, and I turn to my buddy and ask, **"How many have we done?"** My buddy often said, "I forgot too!"

## To-do list

- [ ] Time count down
- [ ] Function Optional and Setting
- [ ] Add Alarm when Timeout
- [ ] Button volume up and down
